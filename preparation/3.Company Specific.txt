✅ 1. Why did you leave DXC?

"DXC was a great learning experience for me. I worked with excellent teams and gained strong technical and domain knowledge. However, after spending several years there, I felt that I had reached a point where I needed new challenges and opportunities for growth. I’m now looking for a role where I can work on more advanced technologies, take greater ownership, and continue progressing in my career. I’m grateful for what I learned at DXC, and now I’m ready for the next step."

✅ 2. Why this company?

*"I’ve heard great things about this comapny from my friend who has been working here for the last three to four years, especially about the collaborative culture and strong team support. This Company is also one of the largest and most respected IT companies in India with a strong global presence.

What excites me the most is the opportunity to work on diverse projects, learn continuously, and grow in a structured environment. I’m confident that this company offers the right platform for both professional growth and contributing meaningfully through my skills."*

✅ 3. Certifications / Awards

*"I have completed the LOMA 281 certification, which helped strengthen my understanding of the life insurance domain.

I also received the Champs Award four times for consistently delivering high-quality work and contributing to project goals. Additionally, I’ve received multiple client appreciation emails for quick responses and reliable deliveries. These recognitions reflect my commitment, consistency, and focus on delivering value."*

✅ 4. Why are you asking for a 100% hike?

*"Over the years, I’ve gained strong hands-on experience in Core Java, REST APIs, SQL, performance optimization, and end-to-end development. I have delivered measurable results such as leading key modules, improving system performance, and ensuring timely deliveries for clients.

The responsibilities in this new role are more advanced and aligned with the career growth I’m aiming for. Based on the expertise I bring — including problem-solving, debugging skills, mentoring juniors, and handling project ownership — I believe the compensation I’m requesting is a fair reflection of the value I can deliver to the team from day one."*
