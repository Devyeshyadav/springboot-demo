Tell me about yourself

Hi, Thank you for the opportunity. My name is Devyesh Yadav, and I’m a Java Developer with over 4.6 years of experience in designing, building, testing, and optimizing Java-based applications, mainly in the life insurance domain.

I previously worked as an Analyst I – Software Engineer at DXC Technology, where I contributed to multiple projects, including implementing policy workflows, migrating legacy systems, and improving application performance for Allianz clients across Philippines,Indonesia and Malaysia Regions.

My core strengths include Core Java, SQL, and RESTful API development. I’ve also worked with tools like Eclipse, Postman, Git, and SSMS, and I’m well-versed in Agile methodologies and batch monitoring.

I enjoy solving complex problems, collaborating with cross-functional teams, and continuously learning new technologies to enhance my skills. I’m excited about roles where I can contribute to backend development and take on challenging technical responsibilities.

Why Leave DXC 

I had a great experience at my last company and learned a lot, but I felt like it was time to seek out new challenges that align better with my long-term career goals. I’m excited to bring what I’ve learned to a new environment where I can continue to grow.

Why this Company

I’ve heard great things from my friend {{}} who is working in infosys from the last two years about how the team collaborates and supports each other. I’m excited about being part of a team with such a positive dynamic and also infosys is the second largest IT Company in India
